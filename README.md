# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommending System

This is a **content-based movie recommendation system** built using collaborative filtering and KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors). It uses the **MovieLens dataset** and allows users to enter a movie title to receive similar movie recommendations.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Uses collaborative filtering with pivoted user ratings.
- KNN-based similarity search (via scikit-learn).
- Sparse matrix optimization for performance.
- Streamlit web interface for movie recommendations.

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Loads movie and rating data from `movies.csv` and `ratings.csv`.
2. Creates a sparse matrix of ratings.
3. Filters inactive users and unpopular movies.
4. Trains a KNN model to compute similarity between movies.
5. Takes a movie input and returns 10 similar recommendations.
